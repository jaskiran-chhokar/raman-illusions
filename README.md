# Raman Illusions 

**Raman Illusions** is a multi-page portfolio website that I designed and developed for a client. The main purpose of this site is to showcase the client's work and provide more information about their company. From a technical standpoint, HTML5 is being used for the markup, Sass for the styles and JavaScript (ES6) for interactivity.
